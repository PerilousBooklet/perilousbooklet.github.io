My personal website.

## How it works

The website itself is static (HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript for UI interactivity).

The website is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: main page with information about me
- `blog.html`: blog page with my blog posts (converted to HTML from markdown with a bash script, run locally before every commit)
- `components`: folder which contains the html code to be added to every HTML blog post file
- `lib`: folder which contains the Javascript code
- `style`: folder which contains the theme CSS files for the website
- `assets`: folder which contains the assets for the website
- `about.html`: ?
