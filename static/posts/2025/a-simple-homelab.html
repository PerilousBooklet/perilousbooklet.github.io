        <h2 style="color: #5cb3fa;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In a world dominated by sprawling cloud infrastructure and over-engineered software services, big tech companies 
          have long since decided to betray their original good intentions (see Google's Don't Be Evil pledge) and no longer 
          aim to provide the best quality services for their customers, but to isntead extract as much money as possible from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This profit-first mindset has seeped into nearly every corner of the digital landscape. From Google’s reliance on 
          sponsored search results, to YouTube deliberately slowing performance on certain browsers, and even to streaming 
          platforms where content I’ve paid for can vanish overnight, the pattern is unmistakable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consequences of this approach are wide-ranging, but the one that strikes me most personally is the steady 
          decline in service quality. These practices don't allow me to sleep soundly at night, and I prefer to avoid 
          products and services that embrace them whenever possible. Thankfully, the open source community—powered by 
          thousands of passionate developers—offers a refreshing alternative, with a vast ecosystem of programs that 
          prioritize freedom and functionality over profit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet my motivation goes beyond frustration with big tech. As a passionte tinkerer and programmer, I’m drawn 
          to the challenge and satisfaction of building my own miniature cloud. The idea of running my own servers and 
          hosting my own services is not just practical, it’s exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, the following paragraphs will detail my journey into self-hosting, the obstacles I encountered, 
          and the lessons I learned along the way.

        <h2 style="color: #5cb3fa;">Self-hosting Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          A miniature cloud can take as many forms as the imagination allows.
          ... some examples here ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In my case, I wanted something small but powerful, so I opted for a tiny rack, which is a miniature equivalent
          of the standard, enterprise-class server racks that you find inside datacenters.
          The model that I chose featured 8 1U slots, which is more that enough space for most users, even enthusiasts.
          I must clarify that I am not interested, as others are, in the great speed that 10Gb/s networking equipment
          allows, mostly because my computers still have the 1Gb/s LAN ports and the fact that I only have access to a 1Gb/s 
          fiber connection at home. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In all honesty though, even for downloading heavy games over a 100GBs in size, a full 100MB/s is more than enough. 
          It's also nice not to have to worry about the significant heat and power draw typical of high-speed 
          equipment like 10Gb/s switches.

          ... brief overview/comment on how in recent years there has benn an explosion in the market of mini pcs and mini
          servers, which are perfect for a small homelab at home, both in power and energy efficiency ...

          1. switch + mini server + UPS
          2. tiny rack + switch + a few mini servers + UPS
          3. prod. servers
            - es. an excellent choice are the mini servers from Icewhale (Zimaboard and Zimablade)
            - es. any mini pc will do

          ... brief explanation of my choices in the software stack and why ...
        </p>
        <p>
          1. arch linux + ufw + fail2ban
          1. mdadm (for manual RAID configuration)
          2. bash scripts (for automating complex tasks)
          3. ssh (to connect remotely to servers)
          4. tmux + mynav (to manage multiple programs without containers)
          5. docker compose + lazydocker (to host services)
        </p>
