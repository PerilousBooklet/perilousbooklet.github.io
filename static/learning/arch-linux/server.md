## Remote Access

The standard way of connecting to your servers in your homelab and on a VPS is through SSH.

Also, a self-hosted VPN allows your smartphone and laptop to securely access your homelab's services from outside.

### SSH

> [!NOTE]
> Use `nmap -sP x.x.x.0/24` to scan the LAN for the server's IP (replace `x.x.x.0` with LAN IP address).

#### With password

> [!NOTE]
> Before starting, note down the server's IP address and remember the server's username and password

1. Change the SSH port: `sed -i 's/#Port 22/Port 2237/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
2. Prohibit root login: add `PermitRootLogin no` to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
3. Enable and start the SSH daemon: `sudo systemctl enable --now sshd`
4. Connect to the server remotely (replace `x.x.x.x` with IP address): `ssh -p 2237 username@x.x.x.x`

#### With keys

Generate an SSH key (each user has its own): `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/keyname`

Choose an appropriate key name.

Choose an appropriate security password.

Write down the security password into the password database.

Copy the generated keys to the server (replace `x.x.x.x` with IP address): `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/keyname.pub -p 2237 username@x.x.x.x`

Connect with `ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/keyname -p 2237 username@x.x.x.x`

### WIP: Self-hosted VPN

Wireguard is a simple and fast modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography.

Setting up a VPN is not as straightforward as setting up a conventional service on Docker;
several steps that involve different environments and devices are required:

- Get static home IP (if you can't, use noip.com + auto-update service)
- Setup wireguard container on Docker
- Open port on server firewall
- Open port on home router firewall
- Wireguard android app (client)
- `wireguard-tools` (laptop, manual setup)
- Connect stuff

### Firewall

TODO: brief intro

Install and activate `ufw`:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu ufw iptables
sudo systemctl enable --now ufw.service
```

Set basic firewall rules:

```sh
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 2237/tcp # the port for SSH
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

Set advanced firewall rules:

`sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf`

Copy the following into `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
# IP Spoofing protection
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

# Ignore ICMP broadcast requests
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

# Disable source packet routing
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0 
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

# Ignore send redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

# Block SYN attacks
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5

# Log Martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

# Ignore ICMP redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0 
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

# Ignore Directed pings
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
```

### Malware scanning

TODO: brief intro

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu clamav
```

TODO: config

### Intrusion prevention

TODO: brief intro

Install [fail2ban](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fail2ban): `sudo pacman -Syu fail2ban`.

Enable the fail2ban services: `sudo systemctl enable fail2ban.service`

To ease upgrades (because of pacnew/pacsaves), create a `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` file: `sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

Write the following into `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`:

```
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 1d
```

#### Enable the sshd jail

Write the following into `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`:

```
[sshd]
enabled = true
```

#### Configure the sshd jail to resist getting your IP address locked out of the server

Here's the [full detailed guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fail2ban#Custom_SSH_jail).

> [!NOTE]
> Adjusted for `ufw`

Write the following into `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.local`:

```
[sshd]
enabled   = true
filter    = sshd
banaction = ufw
backend   = systemd
maxretry  = 5
findtime  = 1d
bantime   = 2w
ignoreip  = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1
```

#### Setup email notification when an IP gets banned

`sudo pacman -Syu msmtp msmtp-mta`

Write the following into `s`:

```
[DEFAULT]

...

destemail = yourname@example.com
sender = yourname@example.com

# to ban & send an e-mail with whois report to the destemail.
action = %(action_mw)s

# same as action_mw but also send relevant log lines
#action = %(action_mwl)s

```

(the `...` represent other existing config options)

#### Adjust to work with ufw

WIP: read the following

```
# Fail2Ban action configuration file for ufw
#
# You are required to run "ufw enable" before this will have any effect.
#
# The insert position should be appropriate to block the required traffic.
# A number after an allow rule to the application won't be of much use.

[Definition]

actionstart = 

actionstop = 

actioncheck = 

# ufw does "quickly process packets for which we already have a connection" in before.rules,
# therefore all related sockets should be closed
# actionban is using `ss` to do so, this only handles IPv4 and IPv6.

actionban = if [ -n "<application>" ] && ufw app info "<application>"
            then
              ufw <add> <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> app "<application>" comment "<comment>"
            else
              ufw <add> <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> comment "<comment>"
            fi
            <kill>

actionunban = if [ -n "<application>" ] && ufw app info "<application>"
              then
                ufw delete <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> app "<application>"
              else
                ufw delete <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination>
              fi

# Option: kill-mode
# Notes.: can be set to ss or conntrack (may be extended later with other modes) to immediately drop all connections from banned IP, default empty (no kill)
# Example: banaction = ufw[kill-mode=ss]
kill-mode =

# intern conditional parameter used to provide killing mode after ban:
_kill_ =
_kill_ss = ss -K dst "[<ip>]"
_kill_conntrack = conntrack -D -s "<ip>"

# Option: kill
# Notes.: can be used to specify custom killing feature, by default depending on option kill-mode
# Examples: banaction = ufw[kill='ss -K "dst = [<ip>] && ( sport = :http || sport = :https )"']
#           banaction = ufw[kill='cutter "<ip>"']
kill = <_kill_<kill-mode>>

[Init]
# Option: add
# Notes.: can be set to "insert 1" to insert a rule at certain position (here 1):
add = prepend

# Option: blocktype
# Notes.: reject or deny
blocktype = reject

# Option: destination
# Notes.: The destination address to block in the ufw rule
destination = any

# Option: application
# Notes.: application from sudo ufw app list
application = 

# Option: comment
# Notes.: comment for rule added by fail2ban
comment = by Fail2Ban after <failures> attempts against <name>

### Kernel-space mandatory access control

TODO: brief intro

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu apparmor
```

TODO: config

## Backup

### rsync

[rsync]() is a powerful CLI tool to synchronize files and folders.

> [!NOTE]
> This is NOT a full backup tool, it just creates a remote copy and keeps updating it. It doesn't create snapshots.

The following example script creates a copy of the `/home/origin_username` folder on a remote server through SSH:

`~/.local/bin/backup`

```sh
#!/bin/bash
rsync --archive \
      --compress \
      --times \
      --partial \
      --progress \
      --delete \
      --verbose \
      --human-readable \
      --exclude='.cache' \
      --exclude='.gradle' \
      --exclude='.rustup' \
      -e 'ssh -p 2237' --info=progress2 \
      /home/origin_username \
      server_username@x.x.x.x:/path/to/destination/folder
```

### borg

[borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a backup tool that synchronizes and deduplicates data to a remote repository. This remote repository contains snapshots that vary between each other only for the new modifications applied since the previous snapshot (hence why it's `deduplicating`).

Initialize a new repository: `borg init --encryption=repokey "/path/to/repo"`

List all backups of a specific repository: `borg list "path_to_repo_directory"`

Extract a folder from a borg backup: `borg extract -v --list "repo_path"::backup_name folder_path`

Delete a repository: `borg delete "/path/to/repo"`

## Monitoring

To monitor your servers' state (uptime, resource usage, logs, ...), a monitoring service is indispensable.

[Beszel](https://beszel.dev/) is a simple, minimal and reliable way to keep track of what's happening in your homelab at any point in time.

## Storage

TODO: brief intro

### RAID 1

A `RAID 1` storage setup is useful on a small NAS, to make sure that if one disk dies, the other has a full copy of all the data.

<!-- FIX: DOCS: find a way to remove those excessive `- ...` -->

- Add `mdadm_udev` to the `HOOKS` array of `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`
- Regenerate the initramfs: `sudo mkinitcpio -P`
- Reboot
- Partition the drives (create one `ext4` partition):
- `sudo cfdisk /dev/sda`
- `sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb`
- Build the array:
- `sudo mdadm --create --verbose --level=1 --metadata=1.2 --raid-devices=2 /dev/md/pool /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1`
- Update `mdadm` configuration file:
- `su`
- `mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf`
- `exit`
- Assemble the array:
- `sudo mdadm --assemble --scan`
- Check the array's state:
- `sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md/pool`
- Calculate `stride` and `stripe` width ([source](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID#Calculating_the_stride_and_stripe_width)):
- `stride = chunk size / block size = 512KiB / 4KiB = 128KiB`
- `stripe width = number of data disks * stride = 2 * 128 = 256`
- Format the array with a filesystem: 
- `sudo mkfs.ext4 -v -L pool -b 4096 -E stride=128,stripe-width=256 /dev/md/pool`
- Mount the filesystem: 
- `sudo mkdir -v /pool`
- `sudo mount /dev/md/pool /pool`

## Wiping drives

brief intro

### NVME

Unmount the drive with: `sudo umount /dev/nvme0n1 /path/to/mount/folder`

Format the drive (ideal for reuse or resale, you need the `nvme-cli` package): `sudo nvme format /dev/nvme0n1`

Check if the drive is clean: `sudo file -s /dev/nvme0n1`
